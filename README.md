prediction solution that empowers property owners, tenants, and real estate enthusiasts with insights to make confident decisions. Through 
the synergy of advanced machine learning, streamlined API accessibility, and an interactive web-page, the goal is to achieve a new standard of 0.98 
R-squared accuracy, illuminating the path to informed choices and optimal rental pricing. Here is the future of Barcelona's real estate 
landscape with data-driven innovation.

# Skills

# Repository Details
## API
These files were used for hosting on render. 
```
API
  |---- CustomData.py
  |---- encoding.py
  |---- mlapi.py
  |---- requirements.txt
```
**NOTE:**
After trying to host on multiple platforms, <a href = "https://render.com/">Render</a> finally worked. 
Others failed to work because of constraints.
A Few of the common issues that arise while hosting on Render are

- Version of Scikit Learn on Render is only up to 1.0.2. Therefore it created a problem when my pickled version was from Scikit-Learn version 1.3.0
- In local hosting I used ```uvicorn mlapi:app --reload```. But in render hosting, the start command was ```uvicorn mlapi:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT```

## Streamlit 
These files are used for hosting. 
```
Streamlit
  |---- app.py
  |---- encoding.py
```

## ML Model 
I use MiniConda and Jupyter Notebook to develop ML Models. These files are used for creating the ml model.
```
ML Model
 |---- ml_files
          |---- data.csv
          |---- notebook.ipynb
```
