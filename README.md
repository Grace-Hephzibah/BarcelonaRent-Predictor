# Skills
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **API:** FastAPI, Postman, requests, Pydantic
- **API Hosting:** uvicorn, gunicorn, render
- **ML Model:** Scikit-learn, pickle, numpy
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib
- **Data Handling:** Pandas

# Repository Details
## API
These files were used for hosting on render. 
```
API
  |---- CustomData.py
  |---- encoding.py
  |---- mlapi.py
  |---- api_requirements.txt
  |---- ml_files/model.pkl
  |---- ml_files/.gitattributes
```
**NOTE:**
After trying to host on multiple platforms, <a href = "https://render.com/">Render</a> finally worked. 
Others failed to work because of memory contraints.
Few common issues that rise while hosting on render are

- Version of Scikit Learn on Render is only upto 1.0.2. Therefore it created a problem when my pickled version was from scikit-learn version 1.3.0
- In local hosting I used ```uvicorn mlapi:app --reload```. But in render hosting, the start command was ```uvicorn mlapi:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT```
- The build command is ```pip install -r api_requirements.txt```

## Streamlit 
These files are were used for hosting. 
```
Streamlit
  |---- app.py
  |---- encoding.py
```

## ML Model 
I use MiniConda and Jupyter Notebook to develop ML Model. These files are used for developing the ml model.
```
ML Model
 |---- ml_files
          |---- .gitattributes
          |---- data.csv
          |---- model.pkl
          |---- notebook.ipynb
```
